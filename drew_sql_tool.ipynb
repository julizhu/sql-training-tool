    "### Julie Join Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Joins \n",
    "So far, we have explored how to query information from a single table and transform the values within that table. However, in the situation where the information we need does not exist in our current table, a join is needed to append the appropriate data onto the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Joins for Data Creation \n",
    "Types of Joins\n",
    "Different types of joins will yield different result tables. It is recommended that the final result table is planned out and thought through before performing the join. Let us use the tables mentioned above as examples (pos_line_item and cust_attributes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to join any two tables together, a join key should be used so that the table knows which rows to append together. The join key is typically a field in one table that is supposed to match to a field in the second table. Let’s assume we have two tables, one on the left and one on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples once data is added \n",
    "An **inner** join returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **left** join returns all records from the left table and corresponding matched values from the right table \n",
    "\n",
    "A **right** join returns all records from the right table and corresponding matched values from the left table\n",
    "Note that this is essentially the same as a left join but with the right table\n",
    "\n",
    "An **outer** join returns all records from both tables, but will match the values if the join key is validated\n",
    "\n",
    "An **anti** join returns the records if there is no match in either table   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Join Keys\n",
    "##### Equality vs. inequality  \n",
    "Join keys are the most essential part of a join. A typical join key, as noted in the previous section, consists of a statement that connects one field in the left table to one field in the right table. Typical join statements use equality, but using inequality in join statements is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Joins for Data Filtering**   \n",
    "Joins are more useful than just appending on new data from different sources. They are also effective in optimizing a slow query when rows need to be filtered out (as opposed to using a where clause in conjunction with the “in” function). There are two joins that can help you accomplish this: (1) inner joins and (2) anti joins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples once data is added\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inner Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti Join**   \n",
    "Tips for Joins   \n",
    "Extra caution is needed when joining on a string join key. It is possible that these strings are capitalized differently and encoded differently. It is best practice to check the join key in both tables before performing the join and if needed, mutate the join key so that they match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples once data is added\n",
    "For example, for trim(upper(name)) = trim(upper(campaign))\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing a join, think about what you want the final data set to look like. Write out all the features and which tables you need to retrieve those fields from before you join tables together. This will help you be organized and write cleaner code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to alias tables with a small identifier that is descriptive of the table you are querying from. Tag each field you select with the table identifier so that each field is pulled exactly from the table you want.\n",
